# An OrganIC remedy: Organizational Interface for Cultivation 

***
 ## * This project was one of the <em> selected projects from Ethical Development Hackathon 2021 sent to a group at the Government of Manitoba aiming to crowdsource solutions for food insecure communities.</em>
***

### Premise:
- 1 in 8 Canadian households are food insecure.(4.5 millionCanadians pre-pandemic)
- Provincial disparities: NU households-49.4%;NWT (15.9%),YT (12.6%), NS (10.9%), and MB (10.2%)
- 2 in 5 Canadian University students
- Black and off-reserve Indigenous Canadians are more than twice as likely to be food insecure as white Canadians
- Among households with children: female lone-parent families are most likely (25.1%)
- In 2018, 1.6 million of 14.3 million Canadian households (11.9%) relied on government benefits as their main source of income, of these 22.5% were food insecure.
- Pandemic changes: 1 in 7 Canadian households and Single adults living alone are at high risk.


### Our Solution:
Our project is aimed to work with Indigenous communities living on reserves that are experiencing food insecurity. There will be an online platform that allows for community members to seek out teachers for skills that deal with the cultivation of food, and a community library where people can borrow tools to begin their own home gardens.
