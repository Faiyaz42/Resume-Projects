# Caesar Cipher Decoder ðŸ” 
***
## Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.

## This decoder takes a file with encrypted strings in the format - KEY CIPHERTEXT - and decodes them into plaintext.
