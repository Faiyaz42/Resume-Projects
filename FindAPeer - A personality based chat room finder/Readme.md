The recent Covid-19 pandemic has had significant psychological and social effects on the population. Research has highlighted the impact on psychological well-being of the most exposed groups, including children, college students, and health workers, who are more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and other symptoms of distress.The social distance and the security measures have affected the relationship among people and their perception of empathy toward others.

While there are many social media applications for people to communicate over,however,none of them empahsizes people's personalities when pairing them with someone else.As a result,the two users have a hard time getting along which could lead to frustrations and further exacerbate the the feeling of loneliness.

Our app puts emphasis on people's personalities before pairing them with someone with a similar personality profile.Therefore,right off the bat the two users do not feel like they are talking to a total stranger but somneone who share similar interests and understandings.We have additional features that enable the users to break the ice and talk more freely about their favourite hobbies,places to visit,food etc.
